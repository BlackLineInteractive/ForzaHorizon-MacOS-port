# ReXGlue SDK patches we carry

`patches/rexglue-sdk/` holds this project's patches to the ReXGlue SDK (nightly 0.10.0.24,
commit `bd833a2`); `tools/build_rexglue_sdk.sh` applies them to the clone
`~/rexglue-sdk-src-forza` and installs the patched GPU plugin, runtime and codegen tool into
the overlay `~/rexglue-sdk-patched-forza`. Patches 0001-0035 came from RecompiledHaloReach,
whose `docs/sdk_patches.md` describes each one (the numbers match; this repo leaves out
0010, 0012, 0014, 0024, 0026, 0027 and 0036). Patches written here:

| Patch | Area | What changes | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0037 | Video mode (runtime) | The guest refresh rate (`video_mode_refresh_rate`, its range and `VdQueryVideoMode`'s clamp) may go up to 480 Hz instead of 240 | 144 fps (and other rates above 120) can keep the game's divider of two: a 288 Hz guest vblank. With a 144 Hz vblank and no divider, the emulated GPU's swap waits (which end on a vblank, patch 0030) turn every frame that misses 6.9 ms into a 13.9 ms one: free roam made 72 fps at a 144 fps target. `docs/framerate.md` |

0037 is in `librexruntime.so`, so the overlay carries a patched runtime (as for 0028).
Without it the game falls back on its own: `src/hooks/frame_time.cpp` reads the setting's
range and uses a divider of one when twice the frame rate does not fit.
